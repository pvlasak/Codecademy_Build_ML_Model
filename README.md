DateApp OKCupid: Data  Analysis and application of ML algorithms 

This is my first ML project, which is focused on data analysis and building of machine learning models
with usage of Python Scikit-learn library. 

Non-linear ML algorithms like K-Neighbors Classifier/Regressor, Random Decision Forest Classifier 
and Support Vector Machines have been implemented to classify income category and predict income value,
classify the vegetarianism and classify the sexual orientation respectively.
